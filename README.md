# COLORS v1

# About
This game was inspired by an online color test I came across a couple years ago. While I wasn't able to find the original, I was able to find something similar here (https://www.igame.com/eye-test/).

The premise of the game is simple:
  - Find the block that is a different color from the rest.
  - If correct, the blocks increment closer to becoming the same color.
  - If incorrect, you lose!

Note: This was an initial version I hacked together quickly and could probably use some more features/tweaks :). I'll push out an updated version soon!
